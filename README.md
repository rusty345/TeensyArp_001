# Teensy based arpeggiator for DAW-based workflow
Possibly overkill.

See http://unsilent.art blog for details

I'm not presenting this code as a thing of beauty, but it did solve a problem I had in finding a MIDI arpeggiator to behave the way I wanted.

The hardware is based on a custom dev board I made, but it should run happily on a raw Teensy if you strip out the UI code. I'll add the C++ files for this when I get the chance.

Hope it's useful to you.

Kind regards,
Nick.
